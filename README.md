# The Project about Rule Based Classification

## Business Problem

A game company wants to create new level-based customer definitions (persona) using some features of its customers and create segments based on these new customer definitions and estimate how much new customers who may come according to these segments can earn the company on average.

## Variables

* **SOURCE** - The type of device to which the customer is connected
* **SEX** – The gender of the client
* **COUNTRY** – Customer's country
* **AGE** – The age of the customer
