# Rule-Based-Classification

## Business Problem

A game company wants to create new level-based customer definitions (persona) using some features of its customers and create segments based on these new customer definitions and estimate how much new customers who may come according to these segments can earn the company on average.

**For example:**

It is wanted to determine how much a 25-year-old male user, who is an iOS user from Turkey, can earn on average.

## Dataset Story

**Persona.csv** data set contains the prices of the products sold by an international gaming company and some demographic information of the users who purchased these products. The data set consists of the records formed in each sales transaction. This means that the table is not singled out. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.

## Variables

* **SOURCE** - The type of device to which the customer is connected
* **SEX** – The gender of the client
* **COUNTRY** – Customer's country
* **AGE** – The age of the customer
